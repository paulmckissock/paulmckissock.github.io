Today, I got replies to show up in a thread-like way. I also added replies to my seeds.rb file. I sat in on a retrospective meeting for Pigment. They went over the pros and cons of webflow, how satisfied they think the clients were, and the overall purpose of retrospective meetings. I felt like it was a very informative. After that, I had a 1:1 with Lauren where she went over what it's like to be a project manager and the differences between a product and project manager. It cleared a lot of things up for me. I also met with Noah briefly and he helped me change the names of my commits to include the issue numbers in them.
