Today I had a one on one with David and he showed me cropduster and gave me a bunch of Rails tips. Later on, we had the biweekly dev meeting where Sol and Chris Manning presented. I spent the rest of the day working on the styling for article pages. I got stuck on updating my method that renders all of the comments replies. I couldn't get the spacing and the buttons to work right.
