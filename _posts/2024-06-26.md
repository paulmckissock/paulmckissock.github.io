Today started out with a pairing tour with Nick. I watched him do some MW work then I sat in on a MW meeting with Nick, Chris Jones, Sol, and Maria. Later on, we had another meeting where they planned how they're going to implement a complicated configurator. Later on, I got voting set up haxxor-news. I added JavaScript so that the scores update as soon as the user votes. I wanted to add an indication of whether the user has already voted but I decided I'll wait to do that.
