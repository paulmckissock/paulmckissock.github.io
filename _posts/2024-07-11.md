Today I had a 1:1 with David where I asked him a bunch of questions about Rails. I also met with Ciel and Faye to plan our project more and work on our client presentation. I also went over some feedback from Noah on my code. In the afternoon, I went to the Viget alumni panel. The panel was super inciteful and interesting. After that, we had a happy hour which was fun.
