Today I got stuck for a while changing Ruby versions on my computer. The issue ended up being solved by typing Bundle Exec before the rails commands. After I fixed that, I started working on comment replies. I got a comment page where you can write replies setup. I also tried to make a PR for my reset-password branch but I did the rebasing wrong so I'll try to get that sorted on Monday.
