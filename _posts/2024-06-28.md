This morning I started out by working on adding voting to comments, I was trying to fix an issue with my seeds.rb file giving an error. After that, I paired with Noah and Chris Manning while Chris worked on Donut Chat. After that, we had FLF. After FLF, Ciel taught me and Aubrey how to scrapbook. In the afternoon I met with Sol and he explained some basic JavaScript fundamentals. When I was done with meetings for the day, I got voting setup for comments.
