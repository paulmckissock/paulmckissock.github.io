Today I had a one on one with Noah and we checked in to see how the internship is going so far. For the rest of the day I started on styling HaxxorNews. I started by doing my home page. I went to hackernews.com and looked at its html and tried to make mine a similar format. I ended up getting it to look basically the same as hackernews.com. I also made the heading.
