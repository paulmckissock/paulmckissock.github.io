I had my pairing tour with Sol, where we talked about Rust, his career, and life as a developer. I sat in on a WCS meeting where they looked at budget stuff (Didn't understand most of it). I had a 1:1 with Maria. I paired with Noah and he went over Git and finished up switching my tests to Rspec.
I made standardrb run before every commit on my hackernews clone. I went through suggestions from Noah on my PR and then merged with main.
