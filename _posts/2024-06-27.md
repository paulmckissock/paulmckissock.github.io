I started today with a pairing tour with Chris Jones. He showed me some MW code they work with and I learned the importance of modularity. Later on I had a pairing with Danny where he worked on Donut Chat. He ran into an issue with the Slack api where it would deleted it's message after the user clicks a button. After that, I worked on adding voting to comments in haxxor news.
