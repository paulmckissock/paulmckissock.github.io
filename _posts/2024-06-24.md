Today I added reply functionality to my Hacker News clone. Started working on showing all replies to a comment in a thread-like way, but it's more complicated than I thought it would be. I also sat in on a WCS planning meeting where they went over the features that they will work on over the next few months. had a 1:1 with Noah, we checked-in on my progress and looked at potential other pairings I could have or other mettings I could sit in on. I also had my pairing tour with Nevin, where I watched him work on getting Grafana setup.
