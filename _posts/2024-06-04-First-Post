Today I finished up this blog site. I had a Viget services and teams orientation with Lexie.
 I also had a Lattice Orientation with Aubrey. I went over Rails fundamentals with Noah. In the afternoon, I did the command line tutorial.
 After I finished that, I got started on the Excercism TypeScript tutorial.
